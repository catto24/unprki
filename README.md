# unprki: an unresponsive process killer

unprki is just the first two letters of unresponsive, process, and killer

un(responsive)pr(ocess)ki(ller)



i'm gonna make this simple, for copy and paste purposes:

`
git clone https://github.com/catto24/unprki && cd unprki && chmod +x unprki
`

to launch unprki:

`
./unprki
`




if i'm being honest this script took at most 5 minutes to make lmfao
